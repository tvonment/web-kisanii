My first EP, "Cycle," consists of 5 1/5 pieces of music that I composed and performed with my band during my bachelor concert. These same pieces were then recorded in a studio to create an EP. I need your help to finance the entire production process. In my first album "Cycle," I talk about the highs and lows of my natural cycle, which is a very personal and deeply meaningful theme for me. The project Kisanii is my absolute passion project, and I am putting all my energy into it. With the proceeds from crowdfunding, I will finance the studio days, the mixing process, the musicians, my graphic designer, and the promotional videos.
