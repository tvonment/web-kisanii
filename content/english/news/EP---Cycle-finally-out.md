"Cycle" – Kisanii’s debut EP is out now.

[https://tr.ee/Z4TVNvG4FM](https://tr.ee/Z4TVNvG4FM)
Across five hauntingly honest tracks, Cycle dives into repeating patterns, emotional battles, and the quiet strength it takes to break free. Kisanii's voice cuts deep – bold yet vulnerable – carrying stories of pain, reflection, and release.
With unexpected musical turns and lyrics that linger, Cycle isn’t just an EP. It’s a feeling, a mirror, and a beginning.
